                    Sight Reading is actively reading a piece of music without
                    the help of our muscle memory. Sight Reading is not an
                    inherent gene that musicians are born with, but a skill that
                    can be improved and developed through practice. Sight
                    reading has a steep learning curve as many individuals have
                    trouble even grasping what the notes mean and quit before
                    mastering the basics. That being said, sight reading is such
                    a crucial aspect of music.

                <h1 id="clefs" class="display-4 fw-normal">What are Clefs?</h1>
                <p class="lead fw-normal">
                    Clefs simply is a type of music notation or symbol that is
                    placed at the beginning of the staff. This will indicate the
                    specific pitch of certain notes. The two most common clefs
                    today are Treble and Bass Clef.
                </p>
                <img src="./images/clefs.png" />
                <p class="lead fw-normal">
                    The treble clef is a symbol denoted for all of the notes
                    that are above the middle C. This is also known as the G
                    clef since the curl of the clef encircles around the line
                    where the G note falls on. For keyboard or piano
                    instruments, the treble clef would be displayed on the upper
                    half of the staff.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The bass clef is a symbol denoted for all of the notes that
                    are below the middle C. This is also known as the F clef
                    since the two dots in the bass clef are between the line
                    where the F note falls on. For keyboard or piano
                    instruments, the bass clef would be displayed on the lower
                    half of the staff.

                    Spaces and Lines in the Staff
                </h1>
                <p class="lead fw-normal">
                    The grid in sheet music is called the staff, which is
                    typically composed of 5 horizontal lines and 4 spaces. The
                    figure below shows the lines and spaces that are numbered
                    from bottom to top. Depending on the note, some music notes
                    can rest between two of the lines on the staff while others
                    can rest on top of a line instead.

                <p class="lead fw-normal">
                    Music notes are typically read from left to right on the
                    staff, like a book.
                </p>
                <img src="./images/direction.png" />
                <p class="lead fw-normal">
                    Notes with a lower pitch are normally found at the bottom of
                    the staff, while higher notes can be found at the top of the
                    staff. In the case that the notes do not happen to rest
                    within the music staff, ledger lines are used to extend the
                    staff. There can be as many ledger lines needed for a
                    singular music note, as there is no limit to the number of
                    ledger lines that can appear on the music staff.

                    Note reading can sometimes be difficult especially when the
                    player can not remember the letter that is associated with
                    each note, so acronyms or mnemonics were created to allow
                    prospective music players to remember these notes better.
                    Here are examples of a couple of mnemonics that some
                    musicians use today:
