                    <p class="lead fw-normal">
                        Sight Reading is actively reading a piece of music
                        without the help of our muscle memory. Sight Reading is
                        not an inherent gene that musicians are born with, but a
                        skill that can be improved and developed through
                        practice. Sight reading has a steep learning curve as
                        many individuals have trouble even grasping what the
                        notes mean and quit before mastering the basics. That
                        being said, sight reading is such a crucial aspect of
                        music.

                    <p class="lead fw-normal">
                        Clefs simply is a type of music notation or symbol that
                        is placed at the beginning of the staff. This will
                        indicate the specific pitch of certain notes. The two
                        most common clefs today are Treble and Bass Clef.

                    <p class="lead fw-normal">
                        The treble clef is a symbol denoted for all of the notes
                        that are above the middle C. This is also known as the G
                        clef since the curl of the clef encircles around the
                        line where the G note falls on. For keyboard or piano
                        instruments, the treble clef would be displayed on the
                        upper half of the staff.

                        The bass clef is a symbol denoted for all of the notes
                        that are below the middle C. This is also known as the F
                        clef since the two dots in the bass clef are between the
                        line where the F note falls on. For keyboard or piano
                        instruments, the bass clef would be displayed on the
                        lower half of the staff.
